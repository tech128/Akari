# Akari Url Shortener
This is a browser extension that lets you shorten long urls.

I had to make a change to the manifest.json since the browser was being so damn picky about it.

First you need to get the extension's files into a folder on your pc

Either run git clone https://github.com/tech128/Akari.git

or click the code button and download the zip and extract it somewhere

Now all you need to do to install it is load the unpacked extension in the browser extensions page

edge://extensions

chrome://extensions

Paste either of those into a new window or tab depending upon if you're running edge or chrome

Turn on developer options, then click load unpacked extension

Navigate to where you placed the files for the extension and select folder

That should be it, the extension should be loaded

You might have to click on the extension button at the top right and click a visibility button to make it visible on the toolbar
